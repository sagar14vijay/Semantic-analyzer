# Simple-C-Compiler
This is a simple C compiler that created with lex and yacc and it is my compiler design course project :) <br>
In archlinux simply install byacc and use it for creating y.tab.c and lex for creating y.lex.c

for installing byacc : <br>
`sudo pacman -S byacc #in ArchLinux usually lex is installed on your system  `
<br>                    `sudo apt-get install byacc lex #in Ubuntu `

As you know in yacc the essential parts of a compiler other that parser are integrated in .yacc file and there is no optimization but we have simple semantic analyzer that is also merged with other parts in parser .

I try to generate llvm assembly in order to use llvm's code optimizer and other benefits of it . 

you can do it by using my python script . you need to just give three address code which is generated by compiler to python script as first argument ` python2 threeaddresscode.txt ` 

# Hint 
just look at mybash.sh

:)
